Graphics-Lab
============

###Semester Long Computer Graphics Lab Assignments ( C++ )

1.  Using the midpoint method design an efficient algorithm to scan convert a cubic spline curve expressed in the parametric form.

2. Given 2 ellipses X and Y use scan fill algorithm to color X ∩ Y with RED and X ∩ Y with GREEN and X ∩ Y with YELLOW.

3. Implement Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping algorithm.

4. Implement reflection transformation of a 3D shape about an arbitrary selected plane for display in a 2D screen.

5. Implement the Z-buffer algorithm for hidden surface removal for a set of cubes.

###Instructions
- Each of the folder has two subfolders 
      - **Given** -   The original source code provided by the professor.
      -  **Working** - The final working code.


- The given code will work only on Windows since it depends on Windows API.

- Import all the files of a assignment into a empty C++ project in Visual Studio to run the code.

- Feel free to fork and do whatever you want.

- Contact me if you are unable to run it.
